We started this online ministry in 2004 as a result of past years of prayer and research.\n\nThe Bible is our rule of faith and striving to obey the promptings of Yahuwah's Spirit and the teachings of His word inspires us to call attention to its truths. We believe that Yahuwah does indeed reveal Himself to all those who search for Him with all their heart (Jeremiah 29:13).",
